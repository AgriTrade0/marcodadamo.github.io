IT structure that deals with the management of industrial processes, until the final achievement of production and the market entry of products (fertilizer range). 
Using the fertilizer line repository, you can register the production version at the end of the canvas. 

On the design surface, you can view the three drawn, commit-encoded sides, and print the final drawing.

In the Datasheet canvas section, you can record the technical data of the product, linking it to the current version that you are running.

In the generic structure of the program, each column controls the actions of a single product.
